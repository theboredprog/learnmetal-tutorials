# learnmetal-tutorials
Code repository for LearnMetal.com – a hands-on tutorial series for learning Apple’s Metal graphics API. This repo contains minimal, modern C++ examples that mirror the lessons on the site. Each project builds on the previous to teach the Metal rendering pipeline step by step – from drawing your first triangle to building a complete renderer.
